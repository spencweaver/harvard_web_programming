I built a facebook like app in react

I did JavaScript in index.js
I did react in react.js

Users can log in to see users and posts.

I generated some content using react but could not figure out how to get the fetch function to work for a post method.

Everything works close to previous projects. However, I put a lot of time into linking react separately and trying to get a post fetch to work.
